# Livneh-hydro-extractor

Scripts to help create manageable catchment-scale time series out of Ben Livneh's hydrometeorology data products (http://ciresgroups.colorado.edu/livneh/data).

Livneh, Ben, et al. "[A long-term hydrologically based dataset of land surface fluxes and states for the conterminous United States: Update and extensions](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/23/jcli-d-12-00508.1.xml?tab_body=abstract-display)." Journal of Climate 26.23 (2013): 9384-9392.


Now updated to also work with David Pierce's extended (and slightly different) data product: http://cirrus.ucsd.edu/~pierce/nonsplit_precip/

Pierce, David W., et al. "[An Extreme-Preserving Long-Term Gridded Daily Precipitation Dataset for the Conterminous United States](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/hydr/22/7/JHM-D-20-0212.1.xml)." Journal of Hydrometeorology 22.7 (2021): 1883-1895.
